## My process

I start by identifying the containers for objects, since this helps me understand the general layout, after that I code these containers in HTML, then I add the objects(images, text, buttons) to them.
Once I have a skeleton html, I start adding the CSS, first the colors, font types, sizes.
After that I move on to applying the general layout, margins, heights, this part is usually the tricky one.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This is the second Frontend Mentor challenge that I finish, I am trying to follow the challenge roadmaps so i'm always building new sites that incrementally ramp up the difficulty.

In this challenge I learned more about css and how to use margin/padding to help place the objects in the correct location on screen.

### Continued development

I still need alot of training with the box model and with centralizing images on screen.
